  abstract     = {In the last decade, the detection and attribution science that links climate change to extreme weather and climate events has emerged as a growing field of research with an increasing body of literature. This paper overviews the methods for extreme event attribution (EEA) and discusses the new insights that EEA provides for infrastructure adaptation. We found that EEA can inform stakeholders about current climate risk, support vulnerability-based and hazard-based adaptations, assist in the development of cost-effective adaptation strategies, and enhance justice and equity in the allocation of adaptation resources. As engineering practice shifts from a retrospective approach to a proactive, forward-looking risk management strategy, EEA can be used together with climate projections to enhance the comprehensiveness of decision making, including planning and preparing for unprecedented extreme events. Additionally, attribution assessment can be more useful for adaptation planning when the exposure and vulnerability of communities to past events are analyzed, and future changes in the probability of extreme events are evaluated. Given large uncertainties inherent in event attribution and climate projections, future research should examine the sensitivity of engineering design to climate model uncertainties, and adapt engineering practice, including building codes, to uncertain future conditions. While this study focuses on adaptation planning, EEA can also be a useful tool for informing and enhancing decisions related to climate mitigation.},

  abstract = {Abstract Heavy precipitation events (HPEs) can lead to deadly and costly natural disasters and are critical to the hydrological budget in regions where rainfall variability is high and water resources depend on individual storms. Thus, reliable projections of such events in the future are needed. To provide high-resolution projections under the RCP8.5 scenario for HPEs at the end of the 21st century, and to understand the changes in sub-hourly to daily rainfall patterns, weather research and forecasting (WRF) model simulations of 41 historic HPEs in the eastern Mediterranean are compared with “pseudo global warming” simulations of the same events. This paper presents the changes in rainfall patterns in future storms, decomposed into storms' mean conditional rain rate, duration, and area. A major decrease in rainfall accumulation (−30\% averaged across events) is found throughout future HPEs. This decrease results from a substantial reduction of the rain area of storms (−40\%) and occurs despite an increase in the mean conditional rain intensity (+15\%). The duration of the HPEs decreases (−9\%) in future simulations. Regionally maximal 10-min rain rates increase (+22\%), whereas over most of the region, long-duration rain rates decrease. The consistency of results across events, driven by varying synoptic conditions, suggests that these changes have low sensitivity to the specific synoptic evolution during the events. Future HPEs in the eastern Mediterranean will therefore likely be drier and more spatiotemporally concentrated, with substantial implications on hydrological outcomes of storms.},

  abstract = {Abstract The increase in extreme precipitation with global warming (GW) and associated uncertainties are major challenges for climate adaptation. To project future extreme precipitation on different time and intensity scales (return periods [RPs] from 1 to 100 a and durations from 1 h to 3 days), we use a novel convection-permitting (CP), multi-global climate model ensemble of COSMO-CLM regional simulations with a transient projection time (1971–2100) over Germany. We find an added value of the CP scale (2.8 km) with respect to the representation of hourly extreme precipitation intensities compared to the coarser scale with parametrized deep convection (7 km). In general, the return levels (RLs) calculated from the CP simulations are in better agreement with those of the conventional observation-based risk products for the region for short event durations than for longer durations, where an overestimation by the simulation-based results was found. A maximum climate change signal of 6–8.5\% increase per degree of GW is projected within the CP ensemble, with the largest changes expected for short durations and long RPs. Analysis of the uncertainty in the climate change signal shows a substantial residual standard deviation of a linear approximation, highlighting the need for transient data sets instead of time-slice experiments to increase confidence in the estimates. Furthermore, the ensemble spread is found to be smallest for intensities of short duration, where changes are expected to be based mainly on thermodynamic contributions. The ensemble spread is larger for long, multi-day durations, where a stronger dependence on the dynamical component is ascribed. In addition, an increase in spatial variance of the RLs with GW implies a more variable future climate and points to an increasing importance of accounting for uncertainties.},

  abstract = { One of the most important impacts of a future warmer climate is the projected increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme rainfall events. This increasing trend in extreme rainfall is seen in both the observational record and climate model projections. However, a thorough review of the recent scientific literature paints a complex picture in which the intensification of rainfall extremes depends on a multitude of factors. While some projected rainfall indices follow the Clausius-Clapeyron relationship scaling of an ∼7\% increase in rainfall per 1°C of warming, there is substantial evidence that this scaling depends on rainfall extremes frequency, with longer return period events seeing larger increases, leading to super Clausius-Clapeyron scaling in some cases. The intensification of extreme rainfall events is now well documented at the daily scale but is less clear at the subdaily scale. In recent years, climate model simulations at a finer spatial and temporal resolution, including convection-permitting models, have provided more reliable projections of subdaily rainfall. Recent analyses indicate that rainfall scaling may also increase as a function of duration, such that shorter-duration, longer return period events will likely see the largest rainfall increases in a warmer climate. This has broad implications on the design and the use of rainfall intensity–duration–frequency (IDF) curves, for which both an overall increase in magnitude and a steepening can now be predicted. This paper also presents an overview of measures that have been adopted by various governing bodies to adapt IDF curves to the changing climate. Current measures vary from multiplying historical design rainfall by a simple constant percentage to modulating correction factors based on return periods and to scaling them to the Clausius-Clapeyron relationship based on projected temperature increases. All of these current measures fail to recognize a possible super Clausius-Clapeyron scaling of extreme rainfall and, perhaps more importantly, the increasing scaling toward shorter-duration rainfall and the most extreme rainfall events that will significantly impact stormwater runoff in cities and in small rural catchments. This paper discusses the remaining scientific gaps and offers technical recommendations for practitioners on how to adapt IDF curves to improve climate resilience. },

  abstract = {Abstract A convection-permitting regional climate model (CPRCM) with 2.5 km resolution has been simulated over South Korea for current and future conditions, and the role of convection in the scaling of hourly extreme precipitation (EP) with temperature is examined. It is found that the CPRCM can reproduce the observed super Clausius-Clapeyron (C-C) scaling for hourly EP. Precipitation type estimated based on the convective available potential energy reveals the important role of convection in the super C-C scaling. Fraction of convective rainfall events increases rapidly with temperature, and the contribution of convection becomes dominant in future simulations under high-emission scenarios. In the late 21st century, as temperature ranges shift to warmer conditions, unprecedented hourly extreme rainfall events are projected to occur particularly during the late summer season. Future changes in hourly extreme events are found to be affected much by boundary conditions from different global climate models.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION This report provides a summary of the UK weather and climate through the calendar year 2020, alongside the historical context for a number of essential climate variables. This is the seventh in a series of annual ‘State of the UK climate’ publications and an update to the 2019 report (Kendon et al., 2020). It provides an accessible, authoritative and up-to-date assessment of UK climate trends, variations and extremes based on the most up to date observational datasets of climate quality. The majority of this report is based on observations of temperature, precipitation, sunshine and wind speed from the UK land weather station network as managed by the Met Office and a number of key partners and co-operating volunteers. The observations are carefully managed such that they conform to current best practice observational standards as defined by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). The observations also pass through a range of quality assurance procedures at the Met Office before application for climate monitoring. Time series of near-coast sea-surface temperature and sea-level are also presented and in addition a short section on phenology which provides dates of first leaf and bare tree indicators for four common shrub or tree species. National and regional statistics in this report are from the HadUK-Grid dataset which is the principal source of data (Hollis et al., 2019). Temperature and rainfall series from this dataset extend back to 1884 and 1862, respectively. Details of the datasets used throughout this report and how the various series which are presented are derived are provided in the appendices. The report presents summary statistics for the most recent year 2020 against the most recent decade 2011–2020, the most recent 30-year reference period (1981–2010) and the climate reference period 1961–1990. The full series provide longer-term context, while a comparison is also made to centennial averages for the Central England Temperature series. The decade 2011–2020 is a non-standard reference period, but it provides a 10-year ‘snapshot’ of the most recent experience of the UK's climate and how that compares to historical records. This means differences between 2011 and 2020 and 30-year reference periods may reflect shorter-term decadal variations as well as long-term trends. For this annual publication, the most recent decade (currently 2011–2020) changes every year, while the most recent 30-year reference period (currently 1981–2010) changes every decade. For next year's report, the most recent 30-year reference period will change from 1981–2010 to 1991–2020, while the climate reference period 1961–1990 will be retained. However, this report also includes a brief summary of key differences between preliminary 1991–2020 and 1981–2010 averages for temperature and rainfall. Throughout the report's text the terms “above normal” and “above average” and so on refer to the 1981–2010 baseline reference period unless otherwise stated. The majority of maps in this report show the year 2020 relative to the 1981–2010 reference period—that is, they are anomaly maps which show the spatial variation in this difference from average. Maps of actual values are in most cases not displayed because these are dominated by the underlying climatology, which for this report is of a lesser interest than the year-to-year variability. These data are presented to show what has happened in recent years, not necessarily what is expected to happen in a changing climate. Values quoted in tables throughout this report are rounded, but where the difference between two such values is quoted in the text (e.g., comparing the most recent decade with 1981–2010), this difference is calculated from the original unrounded values. Updates Compared to State of UK Climate 2019 A chart showing global surface temperature has been added. The section on sea level rise has been revised. A section summarizing key differences between preliminary 1991–2010 and 1981–2010 averages has been added. Feedback We would welcome suggestions or recommendations for future annual publications of this report. Please send any feedback to the Met Office at ncic@metoffice.gov.uk This State of the UK Climate report was supported by the Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme funded by BEIS and Defra.},

  abstract = {Abstract Errors and uncertainty in radar estimates of precipitation result both from errors in the basic measurement of reflectivity and from attempts to relate this to the precipitation falling at the ground. If radar data are to be used to their full potential, it is essential that effective measures are taken to mitigate these problems. The automatic processing of radar data that forms part of the UK Met. Office's Nimrod system addresses a number of specific sources of error. These include the identification and removal of spurious echoes resulting from anomalous propagation of the radar beam, errors resulting from variations in the vertical profile of reflectivity and radar sensitivity errors. Routine verification of the surface precipitation estimates has been undertaken, largely through comparison with rain gauge observations, over a range of timescales, which has allowed the benefits of the quality control and correction processes to be quantified. Although the improvement derived varies according to the dominant synoptic situation, an average reduction in the root-mean-square difference between gauge and radar data of 30\% can be achieved.
